    "about": "Hi! I'm Egwim Ikechukwu, a frontend developer from Lagos, Nigeria (he/him). I'm currently training as a mobile developer at Rise, focusing on React Native. I have around 3 years of experience in web and mobile development, working with Next.js, React, React Native, Expo, JavaScript, TypeScript, and more. I also have skills in graphic design using CorelDRAW and Figma, and I’ve taught IT to children.\n\nI build projects to showcase my skills, including this portfolio with an AI chatbot and a blog section. I’m also working on ShowcaseHub, a portfolio CMS, and Campus Crib, a platform for students to find accommodation.\n\nOutside tech, I enjoy music, gaming, anime, traveling, and staying indoors. I’m passionate about AI and Web3, and I play musical instruments occasionally. I’m a team player, highly curious, self-motivated, and believe consistent effort can achieve great results.\n\nFun fact: I love singing in the shower and sometimes get inspired for my projects while jamming to music!",
